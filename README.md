# COMPSCI 377 LAB: Fork and Exec

## Purpose



The TA present in your lab will do a brief explanation of the various parts of this lab, but you are expected to answer all questions by yourself. Please raise your hand if you have any questions during the lab section. Questions and Parts have a number of points marked next to them to signify their weight in this labâ€™s final grade.

Please read through this lab and follow the instructions. After you do that, visit Gradescope and complete the questions associated with this lab by the assigned due date.

**You may work in groups up to 3 to complete this lab. Make sure you submit as a group in Gradescope.**

## Setup

Once you have logged in to Edlab, you can clone this repo using

```bash
git clone 
```

Then you can use `cd` to open the directory you just cloned:

```bash
cd 377-lab-fork-exec
```

This repo includes a Makefile that allows you to locally compile and run all the sample code listed in this tutorial. You can compile them by running `make`. Feel free to modify the source files yourself, after making changes you can run `make` again to build new binaries from your modified files. You can also use `make clean` to remove all the built files, this command is usually used when something went wrong during the compilation so that you can start fresh.
